***********************   Code Explanation with Comments   *************************
1) options State:
Holds the list of options for the dropdown, which will be fetched dynamically from the API.

2) fetchOptions Function:
This function is an async function that uses axios to fetch data from the backend API.
The API response is assumed to contain an array of cities, with each object having a name property. You may need to adjust this depending on your actual API response.
cityOptions is created by mapping the API response to the format { value: 'CityName', label: 'CityName' }, which is required by react-select.
Finally, setOptions(cityOptions) updates the options state with the fetched data.

3)useEffect Hook:
This hook ensures fetchOptions runs only once when the component loads, fetching the options from the API.
handleSelectChange:

4) Updates selectedOptions based on the user’s selection.
Select All and Clear All Functions:

5) selectAll: Sets selectedOptions to all available options.
clearSelection: Clears all selections.

isMulti: Enables multiple selections.
options: Uses the options state populated from the API.
value: Binds to selectedOptions to show selected items as tags.
